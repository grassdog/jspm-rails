# JSPM and Rails

This is an example app that combines JSPM and Rails.

I like the niceness of System.js polyfill and leveraging ES6 features.

I can combine them both.

to add a package just run `jspm install react`.

## Live reload

If you want livereload kick up guard `guard -P livereload` and then your browser should connect to it and you're off to the races.
